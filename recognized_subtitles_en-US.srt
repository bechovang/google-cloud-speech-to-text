218
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,099
Sometimes

219
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,200
it

220
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,500

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:08,400
that's

224
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,699

go

308
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:42,400
really

309
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,800
fast

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,199
perfect.

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:54,900
to

326
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,000
look

327
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,199
at

2:10.

332
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Now,

333
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
listen

334
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,500

337
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,199

340
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,599
No

341
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,400
collie,

342
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,800
that's

343
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,099
my

344
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:36,500

345
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,900

Has

347
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:37,699

352
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,300
So

353
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,099
presumably,

354
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:41,599
she

355
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,099

She

is

366
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,300
not

367
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,599

369
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,199
from

370
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,800
six

371
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,000
to

372
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,199
eight

373
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:58,300
to

374
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,599
build

375
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,000
model

376
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
vehicles,

377
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,400
things

378
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,699
like

379
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,300
cars

380
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,599

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,199
trucks.

382
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,599
But

383
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,000
also

384
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,599
how

385
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:03,800
to

386
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,300
construct

387
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
animals

388
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,800
using

389
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,099
the

390
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:06,400
same

391
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,900
sorts

392
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,000
of

393
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
material

394
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,000
and

395
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,699
technique

396
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:09,699
and

397
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,000
then

398
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,199
they

399
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,599
learn

400
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:10,699
how

401
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:11,099
they

402
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,300
can

403
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,800
program

404
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,000
them

405
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,199
and

406
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,500
make

407
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,599
them

408
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:12,800
move.

409
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,599
So

410
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,699
they

411
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:15,900
do

412
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
they

413
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,000
take

414
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,199
it

415
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,300
out

416
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,600
really

417
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,199
quickly.

418
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,199
We're

419
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,600

if

423
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,300
they

424
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,699
needed

425
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,500
one

426
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,899
another

do.

429
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:25,600
They

430
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,800

is

439
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,100
it

440
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,300
safe

441
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,300

456
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
myself.

457
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Then

458
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,600
they

459
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,800

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,500
a

462
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,699
bit

463
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:43,899
different

465
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,199
is

466
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,300
the

467
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,500
thing

468
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,699
called

469
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,000
an

476
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,000
then

477
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,399
filled

478
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:49,600
it

479
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,500
using

480
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,100

software.

483
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,399
You'd

484
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,600
be

485
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,199
amazed

486
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,300
what

487
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,600
they

488
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,800
come

489
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:54,899
up

490
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,300
with

493
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,000
and

494
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,300
take

495
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,699
home

496
00:04:59,699 --> 00:04:59,899
to

497
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,100
show

498
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,399

500
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,699
Exactly.

501
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,899
And

502
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,199
then

503
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,600
they

504
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,000
also

505
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,399
build

506
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,500
a

507
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,100
robot

508
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,300
in

509
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,399
the

510
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:05,699
shape

511
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:05,800
of

512
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:05,899
a

513
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:06,399
human.

514
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,300
They

515
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
decorated

516
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,500
program

517
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,699
it

518
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:09,899
so

519
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,100
that

520
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,100
it

521
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,300
can

522
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,500
move

523
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:10,899

527
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,699
perfect.

528
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,699
So,

529
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:14,100
is

530
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,300
it

531
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,399
the

532
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,600
same

535
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,500
the

536
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,800
tiny

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,100
engine

538
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,399
is,

539
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,399
it's

540
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:17,600
just

541
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,800
a

542
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,000
bit

543
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,300
50

544
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,699

to,

553
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,699
they

554
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,100
used

555
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,199
to

556
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,399

558
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,300
we

559
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,500
found

560
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,699
